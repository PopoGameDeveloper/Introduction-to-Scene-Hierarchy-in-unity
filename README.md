# Introduction-to-Scene-Hierarchy-in-unity

The Hierarchy window
![Alt text](/1.png)
The default Hierarchy window view when you open a new Unity project
The Hierarchy window displays every GameObject
in a Scene, such as models, Cameras, or Prefabs
You can use the Hierarchy window to sort and group the GameObjects you use in a Scene. When you add or remove GameObjects in the Scene view, you also add or remove them from the Hierarchy window.
The Hierarchy window can also contain other Scenes, with each Scene
 containing their own GameObjects.
